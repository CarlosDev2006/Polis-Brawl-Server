## Configure client
To connect to your server, you need a custom client. Here the only solution is to use a [pre-made client](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14DzpsEEkkD-_zwKXbK3sbe1n6WL0yFQM/view?usp=sharing). Just replace the IP in the frida-gadget config with yours (```/lib/armeabi-v7a/libpolis.config.so```) ```{"interaction":{"interaction":{"type":"script","path":"libscript.so","on_change":"reload","parameters":{"redirectHost":"YOUR_IP","relocate":true}}}```
